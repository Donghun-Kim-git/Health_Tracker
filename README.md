## Overview

The source codes for the project are classified into two categories: front-end and back-end.

The frontend is connected to our backend server; MERN stack and graphQL are used.

##  Using a local server
Please do the following in order to run the local server.
### In a terminal
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```
**It assumes that you operate the both the front-end and back-end components of our application on MacOS or Windows.**
